## Day 1
okay so today i created a Navbar component, made it completely responsive, used react router to increase performance by not reloding the navbar every time a new page is opened, and for that i created a Layout file where i used the oulet component from react router dom. Then in the main.jsx file i created a browser router and init i used createRouterFromElement function and inside it is where i have a Router tag which stores the path and the element/component of the page.
